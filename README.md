# Batsugun MiSTer Core

This is a vibe coded, MAME-based Batsugun arcade core for the MiSTer FPGA.
It is built on top of the excellent work from [Erin Olafsen](https://github.com/va7deo) (Toaplan Scaffolding) and [Pramod Somashakar](https://github.com/psomashekar) (GP9001 implementation).

Save state code is thanks to [WickerWaka](https://github.com/wickerwaka)'s amazing work with the TaitoF2 and PGM cores. This made chasing down bugs MUCH easier.

**This core is vibe coded based on MAME. Its built binaries and MRAs live in the [Slop Core Repo](https://github.com/TheJesusFish/Slop-Core)**.

## Hardware Reference

MAME models Batsugun as:

- Motorola 68000 main CPU at 16 MHz.
- NEC V25 audio/control CPU at 16 MHz.
- Two GP9001 video devices clocked from 27 MHz.
- YM2151 at 27 MHz / 8.
- OKIM6295 at 32 MHz / 8, pin 7 low.
- Raster timing: 27 MHz / 4 pixel clock, 432 total horizontal clocks, 320 visible pixels, 262 total lines, 240 visible lines.
